# Molecule-Solubility-ML

## Description

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical molecules using their molecular descriptors. Solubility is a critical property in pharmaceutical and chemical research, as it influences a compound's bioavailability, formulation, and overall effectiveness.

The model takes molecular representations, typically in the form of SMILES strings, and computes a range of descriptors to use as input features. Various regression algorithms are explored and evaluated to determine the best-performing model in terms of predictive accuracy.

This project includes data preprocessing methods, feature extraction using cheminformatics tools, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. It serves as a foundation for more advanced applications in computational chemistry and drug discovery.
